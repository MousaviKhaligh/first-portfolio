<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Taha Mousavi, a passionate third-year Computer Engineering student with a deep curiosity for technology and personal growth. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how things work whether it’s software, systems, or the human mind.

  I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and grow. I see every project as an opportunity to sharpen my skills and think critically.
  
  Beyond coding, I’m driven by a simple goal: to become a better version of myself every day. I believe that technology isn’t just about writing code it’s about solving real problems, making an impact, and continuously evolving.
